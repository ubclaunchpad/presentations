# Contributing

All contributions should be made through Pull Requests.

## Directories

Each presentation should be part of a relevant sub-directory of one of the
top-level directories. For example:

```
presentations/
├── projects/
│   └── inertia/
|       ├── README.md
│       ├── inertia-demo-1.pdf
│       ├── inertia-demo-2.pdf
│       └── inertia-demo-3.pdf
```

## Format

App presentations should be in PDF format. Links to other formats and media
(such as videos and websites) should be placed in a `README.md` file within
the relevant directory.
